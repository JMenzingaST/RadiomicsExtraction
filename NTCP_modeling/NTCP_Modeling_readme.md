All the scripts in this folder were developed by L. V. van Dijk. Some minor modifications have been made to suit my needs better.

This folder contains the scripts that are used in the preprocessing of the data for use in an NTCP model, and the creation of the NTCP model itself. This includes steps like (bootstrapped) forward selection as well as creating a reference model to compare the results of any new NTCP models to.

First run step 1, then step 2, but be sure to update the file-path's in the scripts to match your situation. To force certain features into the forward selection, 'forward_sel_logistic.R' needs  to be edited.
